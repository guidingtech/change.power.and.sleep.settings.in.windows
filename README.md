Windows comes with an idle feature which puts a computer into Sleep Mode to save energy and battery life.  In Sleep Mode, the computer halts all the activities, and the state is saved. When you are up to handle the system, it wakes up to the state as you left. In this guide, we are sharing how to change sleep settings in Windows 11/10.

## How Sleep Mode works in Windows 11/10

If you have noticed, your monitor turns off after a few minutes of inactivity. Now, thatâ€™s not Sleep Mode. Since the Display consumes a lot of power, turning off the screen is the first step Windows takes. It is ideal for situations where you will start using your computer in a few minutes.

In Sleep Mode, also generally referred to as Standby or Suspended Mode, the state of the computer is saved on the RAM. It looks as if it has been shut down. While you may hear fans running at a shallow speed, it only means, the computer is still on, and waiting for input from the mouse or keyboard.
